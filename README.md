# Ground Water Quality Prediction

## Overview

This project provides a thorough analysis and prediction workflow for ground water quality assessment using machine learning. The goal is to build, evaluate, and visualize predictive models that can support water resource management and public health initiatives.

---

## Dataset

- The notebook uses a ground water quality dataset containing multiple physical, chemical, and environmental parameters measured at different locations.
- Features may include: pH, dissolved oxygen, hardness, chemical concentrations (e.g., fluoride, nitrate), and more.
- The target variable typically represents a water quality class (e.g., safe/unsafe or categorical index) or a specific chemical level to be predicted.

## Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**
   - Reads CSV or Excel data into pandas.
   - Cleans null or anomalous records, handles outliers, and standardizes feature names.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Summary statistics, class balance, outlier analysis.
   - Visualization: histograms, boxplots, heatmaps, and pairplots to explore distributions and relationships.
3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Scaling/normalization as appropriate.
   - Feature selection and importance assessment.
   - Optionally: creation of synthetic features or interactions.
4. **Model Building**
   - Trains a variety of classifiers/regressors (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost).
   - Includes basic hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.
5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Calculates accuracy, recall, precision, F1 score, and ROC/AUC (if classification).
   - Generates confusion matrix, error analysis, and comparative model plots.
6. **Visualization**
   - Plots actual vs. predicted values, ROC curves, feature importances, etc.
   - Interactive visual summaries for interpretability.
7. **Result Interpretation & Recommendation**
   - Identifies key water quality indicators and interprets the best model's findings in context.
   - Provides data-driven recommendations for target variable improvement.

## Results

- Achieves strong predictive performance for ground water classification/regression (see notebook for model metrics).
- Provides clear visual and tabular summaries of most influential water quality features.
- The workflow can be adapted to other environmental, chemical, or health-related prediction problems.
